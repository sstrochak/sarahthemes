This package is derived from [`urbnthemes`](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/urbnthemes), a set of tools for creating Urban Institute-themed plots and maps in R. `urbnthemes` was created by Aaron Williams at the Urban Institute. 

Inspiration for the color scheme was inspired by [`inauguration`](https://github.com/ciannabp/inauguration), an R-package created by Cianna Bedford-Peterson, inspired by the colors from the 2021 inauguration.
