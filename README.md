# sarahthemes

This package is derived from
[`urbnthemes`](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/urbnthemes), a set of
tools for creating Urban Institute-themed plots and maps in R.
`urbnthemes` was created by Aaron Williams at the Urban Institute.

Inspiration for the color scheme was inspired by
[`inauguration`](https://github.com/ciannabp/inauguration), an R-package
created by Cianna Bedford-Peterson, inspired by the colors from the 2021
inauguration.
